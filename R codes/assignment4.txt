In this assignment, you would use the CART as well as NNW methods for each of the two datasets (attached). This exercise will help you get a feel for
(a) use of CART methods to down select variables (and get a rule-based model), and
(b) use of NNW method (get a black-box model)
(c) trade-offs between simplicity and accuracy of models

CLASSIFICATION ANALYSIS
Problem - 1: (Use the dataset eBayAuctions.csv) [ 40 points]
A. Review the Problem # 9.1 (on page 234 of the text book);
      (i) Attempt parts a, b, and c only (using CART method) [15 points]
       (ii) Find and examine the confusion matrix [ 5 points]
B. Redo the Problem # 9.1  
       (i) Now try the Neural Networks method --  1 hidden layer with 3 nodes; [10 points]
       (ii) Find and examine the confusion matrix [ 5 points]
C. Compare the Confusion Matrices from Part - A and B  [5 points]
